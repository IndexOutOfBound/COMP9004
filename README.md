# 1.Introduction

## 1.1 What real word system is your model a model of?

## 1.2 Why is this system of interest? to whom?

## 1.3 What questions of interest about this system can be addressed using your model

## 1.4 Why is this system 'complex'?
> A set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network
- made up of grains, people
- people collect grains and compete with others
- the number of the poor, the middle and the rich are non-linear
- set the average number for each group of people, then it will eventually become to the poor have most of people, the middle have few and the rich have very few.

# Model Description

## What assumption does your model make?
- The initial people distribute randomly in the world.
- An individual will be given random grains when they born 

## Description
This model has three basic objects: the world, people and grains. The world is a field with many grids. The grain grow in grids with a grown period. Each individual will gain random grains when they born and counsume grains to keep alive. They keep looking for grains around the word. If they run out of grains, they will die.


# 3. Experiments
## 3.1 What `system level properties` can we measure to describe model behaviour?
- **Emergence**:
    In this model, we can see the global number of threee groups that are not apparent from observing any individul people. and we could not predict the shape of the tendency on the basis of observing an individual's wealth.
- **Self-organisation**:
    The tendency that the poor become poorer and the rich become richer is not imposed externally, but results from a set of rules describing how each individual collect grains.
- **Decentralisation**:
    Each individual act independently.
- **Feedback**:
    


## 3.2 What model behaviours can you use to compare the behaviour of the two model implementations?(Netlogo Vs. Python)



## 3.3 which Parameters will you need to vary to explore these behaviours?


## 3.4 How will you describe/report the results of these comparisons?
